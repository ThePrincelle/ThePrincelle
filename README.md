### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Geek by nature. I like code and music. I play the piano in my spare time and sing once in a while. 

I talk about technology, smart house and artificial intelligence. 

To entertain myself, I watch TV shows and read books. 

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on updating my smarthome system.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning machine learning, math, VueJS, Postgres replication.

If you want to learn more about me and what I do, check my website : [princelle.org](https://princelle.org/en) and my GitHub.
