### Hi there 👋

Just here for a good time.

Student in Computer Science & Pianist. 🏳️‍🌈

Geek by nature. I like code and music. I play the piano in my spare time and sing once in a while. 

I talk about technology, smart house and artificial intelligence. 

To entertain myself, I watch TV shows and read books. 

🔭 I’m currently working on updating my smarthome system.

🌱 I’m currently learning machine learning, math, VueJS and MongoDB.

If you want to learn more about me and what I do, check my website : [princelle.org](https://princelle.org/en) and my GitHub.
