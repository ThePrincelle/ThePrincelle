### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Nerdy and a bit of a hopeless romantic. Music helps my pain.

I talk about technology in genreral (web related mostly but Apple linked stuff too), smart house and artificial intelligence. 

To entertain myself, I watch TV shows and movies, read books, [listen to a LOT of music](https://music.apple.com/profile/ThePrincelle) and sing once in a while... 

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my nuxt portfolio with TailwindCSS + Nuxt.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning AI & ML.

If you want to learn more about me and what I do, check my GitHub and my (soon to be updated) website : [maxime.princelle.org](https://maxime.princelle.org/en).
